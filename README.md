## Setup Instructions

Depending on your package manager, install the required depencies in both apps. I used `Yarn` in development.

Do `yarn install` OR `npm i` from both `/client` and `/api` folders to install the necessary dependencies.

Create a `.env` in `/api` for the MongoDB connection, following `.env.example`. 

To start either app, do `npm start` or `yarn start` from their respective root folders.
